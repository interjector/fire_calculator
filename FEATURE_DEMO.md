# FIRE Calculator - New Features Demo

## ðŸŽ¯ Three Major New Features Implemented

### 1. FIRE Variations Toggle
**What it does**: Allows users to toggle between different FIRE strategies and see all target lines on the chart.

**FIRE Types Available**:
- **Lean FIRE** (60% spending): $900,000 target for $36,000/year
- **Coast FIRE** (standard): $1,500,000 target for $60,000/year  
- **Barista FIRE** (80% spending): $1,200,000 target for $48,000/year
- **Regular FIRE** (100% spending): $1,500,000 target for $60,000/year
- **Fat FIRE** (180% spending): $2,700,000 target for $108,000/year

**Chart Enhancement**: Shows all FIRE target lines as dashed lines on the portfolio chart, making it easy to see which FIRE level you'll hit first.

### 2. Windfall Support
**What it does**: Allows modeling of one-time windfalls like inheritance, bonuses, or lottery winnings.

**Example Impact**:
- Base scenario: 20 years to FIRE
- With $100K windfall at age 35: Accelerates portfolio growth
- Windfall gets added to portfolio value in the specified year
- Shows up in detailed table as "Windfall" column

**Use Cases**:
- Inheritance planning
- Stock option vesting
- Bonus expectations
- Insurance payouts

### 3. Large Expense Planning
**What it does**: Models redirecting investment contributions toward a major purchase (like an adventure van).

**How it works**:
- Specify target age for purchase (e.g., age 42)
- Set purchase amount (e.g., $75,000 for adventure van)
- Choose contribution reduction % (e.g., 50% = half of annual contributions go to purchase fund)
- Shows impact on FIRE timeline

**Example Impact** (Adventure Van at Age 42):
- Normal portfolio at 42: $728,735
- With van expense: $505,130 + $75,000 van = $580,130 net
- Total impact: ~$148K reduction in portfolio growth
- Shows as "Large Expense" in detailed table

## ðŸŽ¨ Visual Enhancements

### Enhanced Portfolio Chart
- **Multiple FIRE Target Lines**: See Lean, Coast, Barista, Regular, and Fat FIRE targets
- **Windfall Indicators**: Spikes in portfolio value when windfalls occur
- **Expense Visualization**: Portfolio dips when large expenses are made

### Detailed Table Improvements
- **Windfall Column**: Shows windfall amounts by year
- **Large Expense Column**: Shows when major purchases occur
- **Enhanced Filtering**: View accumulation vs. withdrawal phases
