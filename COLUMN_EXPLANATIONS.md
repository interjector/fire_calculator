# FIRE Calculator - Table Column Explanations

## üìä Understanding Your Projection Table

The detailed table shows year-by-year projections with these key columns:

### Core Portfolio Metrics
- **Year**: Project year (0 = current year)
- **Age**: Your age in that year
- **Portfolio Value**: Total investment portfolio value
- **Annual Contribution**: Money added to portfolio that year

### FIRE Analysis Columns
- **Sustainable Withdrawal**: 4% of portfolio value (what you COULD withdraw)
- **Spending Need**: Your expenses adjusted for inflation (what you NEED)  
- **Net Need**: Spending minus all income sources (what portfolio must provide)
- **Surplus/Deficit**: Sustainable Withdrawal minus Net Need

### Income Sources
- **Part-Time Income**: Income from part-time work (scenario-specific)
- **Social Security**: Government benefits (starts at SS age)
- **Windfall**: One-time bonuses, inheritance, etc.

### Major Expenses
- **Large Expense**: Major purchases (adventure van, home, etc.)

### Status
- **FIRE Status**: ‚úÖ FIRE achieved or ‚è≥ Still accumulating

## üéØ Key Insight: When is FIRE Achieved?

**FIRE is achieved when: Sustainable Withdrawal ‚â• Net Need**

This means your portfolio can generate enough income (4% rule) to cover your expenses after accounting for other income sources.

## üí° Example Interpretation

| Age | Portfolio | Sustainable Withdrawal | Spending Need | Social Security | Net Need | Surplus/Deficit | Status |
|-----|-----------|----------------------|---------------|-----------------|----------|-----------------|---------|
| 62  | $1,200,000| $48,000             | $65,000       | $0              | $65,000  | -$17,000       | ‚è≥ Accumulating |
| 67  | $1,500,000| $60,000             | $75,000       | $30,000         | $45,000  | +$15,000       | ‚úÖ FIRE |

**What this shows**:
- At 62: Portfolio generates $48K but need $65K ‚Üí Not ready for FIRE
- At 67: Portfolio generates $60K, need only $45K after Social Security ‚Üí FIRE achieved!

## üöê Adventure Van Example

If planning a $75K adventure van at age 42:

| Age | Portfolio | Large Expense | Net Impact |
|-----|-----------|---------------|------------|
| 41  | $650,000  | $0           | Building van fund |
| 42  | $575,000  | $75,000      | Van purchased, portfolio reduced |
| 43  | $610,000  | $0           | Portfolio recovering |

The van delays FIRE by ~2-3 years but enables your adventure lifestyle!

## üåü Windfall Impact

$100K inheritance at age 35:

| Age | Portfolio | Windfall | Net Portfolio |
|-----|-----------|----------|---------------|
| 34  | $275,000  | $0       | $275,000     |
| 35  | $350,000  | $100,000 | $450,000     |
| 36  | $475,000  | $0       | $475,000     |

The windfall accelerates FIRE by ~3-4 years!
